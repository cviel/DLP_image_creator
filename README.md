# DLP_image_creator
Matlab code to create DLP image


To generate a video, firt copy/paste the two matlab code in a new file. Choose a picture as reference to generate the video, a long panorama ideally.
Start the programm "Picture_creation.mat" after enter the parameters for your video : this programm will generate picture which will be used in the programm "Create_video.mat" after. 
Don't be surprised by the picture created: remember the DLP will display the information inside the pictures in specific order.
When "Picture_creation.mat" is done, start the the programm "Create_video.mat" to generate the video. WARNING : this video must NOT be compressed, else frames will become random pattern for the DLP.

Please think to cite our article "Implementation of a 1440Hz video projector for calibrating optic flow sensors at high speed" if this code has been usefull for you. Thank you very much !
